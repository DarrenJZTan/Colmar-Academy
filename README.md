# Colmar Academy
**Welcome to Colmar Academy Project Learning Exercise**

This was done during my time learning HTML and CSS with the Generation Australia program. This is a project is provided by Codecademy to recreate a responsive page.

**What does this project entail?**

-   Recreate a responsive web page based on a wireframe which contains the positioning of the elements on a page without specifying any other design information 
-   Using my HTML and CSS skills I obtained during the my time at Generation Australia 
-   Working in a limited time, by ourselves to complete the task

**Limitations**
-   Done during my first 6 weeks after learning about coding
-   Had one day to complete this task

**Special Thanks To**
-   Codecademy 
-   Generation Australia
